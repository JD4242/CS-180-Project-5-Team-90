### General Information
This project, completed by Jonathan Dufresne, Kyle Choi, and Jordan Daniel was a social network profile application. Our GUI took advantage of JFrame, JPanel, and JLabels (among others), in order to create a modern and chic look to our application. As our group originally had four members, we were originally required to select 2 selections. However, due to Ryan Donnelly's lack of presence, we continued with only one selection. The selection that we have decided to proceed with is under Option 2, selection 1: Users can import or export profiles using a csv file. As we were unsure if Ryan was going to participate when starting this project, we created a barebones GUI in his part that would fall under Option 2, selection 3: Users can view a list of all the application's users and send any given individual a friend request or view their profile.

The main focus of the application was to create a simple yet modern profile that would display some basic information such as username, name, friends list, and interests. This application is capable of users making an account, storing that account on a database, and logging into a pre-existing account with all the correct information displayed. This is done by creating a server and client that handles all the back end programming.

### Collaboration
As mentioned above, Ryan Donnelly failed to participate in this project. Thus, the team each split into our own areas of expertise. Jonathan created the server and client, as well as most of the back end programming that would go on behind the scenes. He worked on implementing the GUIs from other team members into the client, and made sure to reach out if any errors occurred. Kyle worked on most of the front end programming, as he designed the profile, login, registration, friends, interests, and error GUIs. Whenever anything from the back end was needed, e.g. sending a message when a certain button was pressed, he made sure to implement the functionality as well as making sure all user interactions were GUI based. Jordan worked on the friend requests GUI, which would display a list of all users with the added capability of having a button to send the specific user a friend requeset.

### Report Submission
